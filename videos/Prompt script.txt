Area 1

		- put high up to direct players attention
		- broken pathway to show age of area & light platforming
	- final
		- added 2 paths just for aesthetic
		- used lighting to show player correct path to articfact

Passage
	- drafts

		- heard of animals in the way
		- rocks blocking exit
		- used as ways to get player to test abilities
		- twisted shape, implies its made from natural cave

		- each room has collectable item to unlock portal
			- room 1: use block to bridge gap in floor
			- room 2: climb up broken path to reach collectable
			- room 3: find path across floor tiles to reach collectable & secret tunnel
			- room 4: must allign statues to get collectable
		- portal door has buttons to push in order to unlock

	- final
		- only one animal in room 1 to save space
		- added lip to edge in room 2 to stop block bridge from falling

		- made floor tiles floating blocks
			- player could run across without noticing falling floor
		- swapped statues for objs that go with specific pedistals
		- buttons removed from door, only ramp appears and portal activates when all items collected
			- buttons made no sense if items already collected
		- only used one trap in secret tunnel, path was too short
